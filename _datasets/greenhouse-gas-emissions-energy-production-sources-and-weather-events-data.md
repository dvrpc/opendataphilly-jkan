notes: "Every five years, DVRPC performs a regional energy use and GHG emissions\n\
  inventory of the Greater Philadelphia region. The inventory looks at energy\nuse\
  \ and GHG emissions associated with the residential, commercial,\ntransportation,\
  \ and other sectors of the region. The inventory does not\ninclude energy use or\
  \ GHG emissions associated with the production of imports\nto the region, other\
  \ than electricity. GHG emissions are generally reported in\nmetric tons of carbon\
  \ dioxide equivalent (CO2e) units. This measure accounts\nfor other gases, such\
  \ as methane and nitrous oxide, as well as\nhydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons,\
  \ which are emitted in smaller\namounts\u2014but are more powerful GHGs\u2014than\
  \ carbon dioxide (CO2). Energy\nproduction source data is reported from the U.S.\
  \ Environmental Protection\nAgency, Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database\
  \ (eGRID). And\nweather trends data are from the National Oceanic & Atmospheric\n\
  Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\n"
