notes: "This layer represents footprints of transit parking facilities in the DVRPC\n\
  region. Additionally, parking facilities at stations on SEPTA's\nWilmington/Newark\
  \ Line in New Castle County, Delaware (and several park & ride\nlots in that county)\
  \ are included. The features in this layer were generated\nby digitizing all discernable\
  \ parking areas that are associated with transit\nfacilities using the best available\
  \ aerial imagery.\n\nIncluded in this layer\u2019s attribute table is a field that\
  \ contains a link to\nthe facilities\u2019 webpage (if available). These pages are\
  \ maintained by the\ntransit provider who operates the facility.\n\nPlease note,\
  \ although efforts were made to ensure its completeness and\naccuracy, this layer\
  \ is not a definitive inventory of the region's transit\nparking facilities and\
  \ should not be considered as such.\n\n"
