notes: 'NJDOT has revised the New Jersey urban area based upon the 2010 U.S. Census

  urban area boundaries. The U.S. Census defines an Urban Area as any area with

  a population >= 2,500. Under the Urban Area definition, Urban Clusters are

  2,500-49,999 and Urbanized Areas are >= 50,000. FHWA, however, defines urban

  areas slightly different. Under FHWA, an Urban Area is >= 5,000, with Small

  Urban Areas 5,000-49,999 and Urbanized Areas >= 50,000. NJDOT followed the

  FHWA urban area definitions for this urban area update. To perform this

  update, NJDOT first combined the 2000 NJDOT urban area with the 2010 US Census

  urban areas greater than 5,000 in population. Since census urban area

  boundaries are based upon census block boundaries, which can be irregular,

  NJDOT extended outward the urban area ("smoothed") to the nearest road,

  stream, political boundary, or manmade feature using the 2012 NJ orthophotos

  as a base map. Where there was no obvious boundary to smooth to, the census

  boundary was retained. NJDOT also expanded the urban area to include any

  densely developed areas not included in the 2000 NJDOT urban area or 2010

  Census urban areas.


  The urban area update went through a thorough public review and comment

  period. Representatives from NJDOT, all 21 counties, and the 3 metropolitan

  planning and organizations (NJTPA, SJTPO, and DVRPC) met during various phases

  of the project to review the updated urban area. All comments were logged into

  an Urban Area Comment Tracking Form, and an official NJDOT response was

  provided for each comment.
