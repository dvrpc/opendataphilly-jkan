notes: 'The American Community Survey (ACS) reports household income by the average
  of

  each income quintile. A quintile is any fifth of households sorted from least

  to greatest income. The first quintile is bottom 20% of households by income,

  the second quintile contains households between 20% and 40% of income (the

  next 20%), and so on. The fifth quintile is the top 20% of households by

  income. Within this group, and also reported in the ACS, is the top 5% of

  households. Gaps in household median income by the racial and ethnic group of

  the householder are also summarized. Median earnings by sex are summarized,

  along with the difference, or gap, between male and female.
