notes: "A statistical method called a dissimilarity index was used to quantify how\n\
  segregated the region is among its census tracts, first by race and ethnicity,\n\
  and then by income. The indices use decennial census tract data for years 1990\n\
  and 2000. The U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Communities Survey (ACS) five-year\n\
  period estimates. The Racial/Ethnic Segregation Index is an indicator of how\nsegregated\
  \ the region's census tracts are, relative to the regional\ndistribution of white,\
  \ non-Latinx population and people of color and Latinx\npopulations. In a given\
  \ year, values show dissimilarity in the racial and\nethnic makeup of tracts across\
  \ the region, and demonstrates the percentage of\nthe population that would, theoretically,\
  \ need to relocate in order to match\nthe region's racial and ethnic makeup. The\
  \ higher the index value, the higher\nthe segregation is among white, non-Latinx\
  \ and other races/ethnicities. The\nIncome Segregation Index is an indicator of\
  \ how segregated the region's census\ntracts are by income, relative to the regional\
  \ distribution of low-income\nhouseholds. Low-income is defined as households below\
  \ 200% of the federal\npoverty rate. This index shows dissimilarity in income for\
  \ census tracts\nacross the region for each year displayed, and demonstrates what\
  \ percentage of\nthe population would need to relocate to another census tract in\
  \ order to\nmatch the income distribution for the entire region. The higher the\
  \ index\nvalue, the greater the geographic concentration of wealth or poverty.\n\
