notes: "This shapefile is intended as a master shapefile of non-Circuit trails in\n\
  DVRPC's four New Jersey counties. It was compiled by DVRPC using several\nsources\
  \ including county open data portals, PDF park and trail maps available\nonline,\
  \ and Google Maps' trails layer. Trails were corrected and verified\nmanually using\
  \ leaf-off Nearmap and Google imagery as well as PDF maps and\nStrava.com where\
  \ aerial imagery was not sufficient.\n\ntrail_name: The trail name field was inherited\
  \ from individual source\nshapefiles and edited when necessary. Where possible,\
  \ trail_name represents\nthe official name of the trail. In the case that official\
  \ names were not\navailable, descriptive, colloquial names were added.\n\ncounty:\
  \ This field refers to the county the trail exists in.\n\nowner: This field refers\
  \ to the agency/organization responsible for the trail.\n\nsurface_type: The surface_type\
  \ field includes the primary surface material\nbased on the following categories:\n\
  \n  * Crushed Stone/Gravel, Dirt, Grass, Paved (includes asphalt, concrete, and\
  \ other hard surfaces), Stone Dust, and Varies (in the case where a trail is composed\
  \ of more than one surface material)\n\nmulti_use: This field indicates whether\
  \ a trail is suitable for more than one\nuse, e.g. walking, hiking, biking, horseback\
  \ riding, etc. Where possible, the\nwidth of trails was measured to determine compliance\
  \ with AASHTO standards.\n\nverif_status: This field indicates whether the trail\
  \ segment is fully\nverified. For records that were able to be verified, this field\
  \ contains the\nvalue 'Verified'. For records that were not able to be verified,\
  \ this field is\nleft blank.\n\nverif_by: This refers to the individual who edited\
  \ and/or verified the trail\nsegment.\n\nverif_date: Date of verification\n\ncomments_dvrpc:\
  \ This field contains notes from the DVRPC planner/analyst about\nany issues or\
  \ observations regarding the trail segment and its verification.\n\n"
