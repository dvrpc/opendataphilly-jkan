notes: "Bridges are inspected every two years at minimum; bridges in poor condition\n\
  are inspected more frequently. These inspections rate the conditions of\nvarious\
  \ bridge elements. The inspection records are stored in a bridge\nmanagement system.\
  \ The Federal Highway Administration annually collects data\non bridges more than\
  \ 20 feet long from each state\u2019s department of\ntransportation, including the\
  \ Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and\nNew Jersey Department of Transportation,\
  \ and stores it in their National\nBridge Inventory. This analysis considers a bridge's\
  \ deck, super, and\nsubstructure ratings, or the culvert rating for a culvert. A\
  \ score between 0\nand 9 is given for each component. Bridges with scores between\
  \ 7 to 9 for all\nthree components are rated \"good,\" those with any component\
  \ scores of 4 or\nlower are rated \"poor.\" A bridge that doesn't fall into a good\
  \ or poor rating\nis considered \u201Cfair\u201D. Most bridges are on state roads\
  \ and are maintained by\nthe state\u2019s department of transportation. Some bridges\
  \ are on local roads and\nare maintained by local governments. The \"Other\" category\
  \ covers bridges\nmaintained by turnpike and toll authorities.\n\n"
