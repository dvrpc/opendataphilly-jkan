notes: "PLANNING CENTERS\n\nAll Connections 2050 Long-Range Plan elements are available\
  \ online at\nwww.dvrpc.org/plan. The Plan has two primary documents:\n\n(1) The\
  \ Connections 2050 Policy Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21027)\nidentifies the\
  \ vision, goals, strategies, and a summary of the financial plan.\n\n(2) The Connections\
  \ 2050 Process and Analysis Manual\n(www.dvrpc.org/Products/21028) provides a more\
  \ detailed look at the Plan\u2019s\noutreach, background information, analysis,\
  \ and financial plan.\n\nThe Connections 2050 Long-Range Plan identifies four types\
  \ of Centers:\nSuburban Centers, Town Centers, Rural Centers, and Planned Centers.\
  \ The\ncharacteristics of each type are as follows:\n\nSUBURBAN CENTERS\n\nAre regionally\
  \ significant; While not necessarily single municipalities, are\nperceived as single\
  \ \u201Cplaces;\u201D Are suburban in character; Are less dense than\ntown centers;\
  \ Lack the integrated mix of uses found in town centers;\n\nAre defined primarily\
  \ by a concentration and variety of office, retail,\nprofessional, and light industrial\
  \ uses, and generally have more jobs than\nresidents; and are generally auto dependent\
  \ rather than transit oriented or\npedestrian scale.\n\nTOWN CENTERS\n\nHave a mixture\
  \ of high-density residential and commercial land use; Have an\nintegrated mix of\
  \ land uses;Have a unique history, character, and sense of\nplace; Are of relatively\
  \ higher density than their surrounding land uses;\n\nHave a distinct downtown/main\
  \ street area surrounded by relatively dense\nresidential development;\n\nAre pedestrian\
  \ friendly and often transit oriented; and Are surrounded by\nsuburban land uses.\n\
  \nRURAL CENTERS\n\nHave a minimum density of six people and three employees per\
  \ developed acre;\nHave an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character,\
  \ and\nsense of place; Are of relatively higher density than the surrounding area;\n\
  \nHave a distinct downtown/main street (though smaller than a town center); and\n\
  Are surrounded by rural and agricultural land uses.\n\nPLANNED CENTERS\n\nAre planned\
  \ town-center-type developments on greenfields in Growing Suburbs or\nRural Areas\
  \ or through redevelopment on greyfields and/or brownfields in\nDeveloped Communities;\
  \ and Have plans that call for village-type development,\nincorporating mixed, integrated\
  \ land uses, relatively high densities, and\npedestrian connections.\n\n"
