notes: 'The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that
  are

  an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S.

  Census Bureau''s Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic

  Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a

  seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each

  TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they

  can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical

  areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads,

  streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city,

  town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of

  streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a

  block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are

  often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common

  misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used

  geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other

  census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints,

  along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a

  result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic

  area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block

  level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Census blocks

  cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas

  (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and

  the U.S. Virgin Islands). Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which

  the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census. A block may

  consist of one or more faces.
