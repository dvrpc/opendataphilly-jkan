notes: 'Municipal boundaries for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and
  the

  District of Columbia with ortho-rectified municipal boundaries for the DVRPC

  Region. Municipal Boundaries have been edited by DVRPC to create a more

  accurate, seemless regional dataset for the DVRPC region and its surrounding

  area. Original data sources (in order of drawing rank): DVRPC - for Mercer,

  Burlington, Camden, Gloucester counties in NJ (an adaptation of NJOIT''s Mun

  Bounds) and Bucks, Montgomery, Philadelphia, Chester, and Delaware counties in

  PA. In most cases, boundaries have been adjusted to align with parcel data.

  NJOIT - remaining NJ counties (2008) PennDOT - remaining PA counties (2009) DE

  State Office of Mgmt & Budget - Delaware municipalities (2002) MD State Hwy

  Administration - Maryland municipalities (2003) **NOTE: NJ''s coast has been

  clipped or unioned to ESRI''s data CD detailed state boundary**
