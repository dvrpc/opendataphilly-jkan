notes: "Housing permit data is derived from reports and publications compiled by the\n\
  U.S. Census Bureau's Residential Construction Statistics Division.\nMunicipalities\
  \ provide the U.S. Census Bureau with tabulations of the number\nof housing units\
  \ authorized, according to types of structures. In the few\ncases where municipalities\
  \ reported building permit approvals for some months\nbut not for all 12 months,\
  \ the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the total yearly\nnumber of units approved based\
  \ on past years\u2019 approvals.\n\n"
