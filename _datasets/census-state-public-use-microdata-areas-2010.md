notes: 'The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that
  are

  an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S.

  Census Bureau''s Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic

  Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a

  seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each

  TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they

  can be combined to cover the entire nation. After each decennial census, the

  Census Bureau delineates Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) for the tabulation

  and dissemination of decennial census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data,

  American Community Survey (ACS) PUMS data, and ACS period estimates. Nesting

  within states, or equivalent entities, PUMAs cover the entirety of the United

  States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. PUMA delineations are

  subject to population, building block geography, geographic nesting, and

  contiguity criteria. Each PUMA is identified by a 5-character numeric census

  code that may contain leading zeros and a descriptive name.
