  This polygon layer delineates the US Congressional District boundaries in New

  Jersey, 2022 - 2032. For this redistricting, the apportionment is the same as

  for the previous, 2012 redistricting, resulting in the same number of

  Congressional Districts; however the boundaries have changed

  significantly.This version of the layer uses high-quality base map spatial

  data published by the State of New Jersey, instead of U.S. Census Bureau

  geographic data (TIGER.) Where no higher-quality data were available, the

  TIGER lines were used. This layer, which overlays correctly the highest

  quality municipal boundary data for New Jersey is an unofficial version; by

  law, the official version is based on U.S. Census data (geographic and

  demographic.)
