notes: 'The Reliability Score layer shows the results of combining TTI, OTP, and

  scheduled speed to calculate the overall measure of reliability. A high

  reliability score (reliscore) is indicative of segments that may benefit from

  targeted improvements to improve transit operations. The Reliability Score was

  weighted by ridership (riderrelis) to highlight segments that impact high

  ridership surface transit service and allow for prioritization of

  improvements.
