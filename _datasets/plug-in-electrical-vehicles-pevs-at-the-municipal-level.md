notes: "Current (2021) and projected numbers of Plug-In Electrical Vehicles (PEVs)\
  \ at\nthe municipal level for the Delaware Valley region. The municipal PEV counts\n\
  were aggregated from the census block group counts, assigning the counts from\n\
  each block group to the municipality housing that block group\u2019s centroid. The\n\
  projected PEV distribution is based on a scenario in which 5 percent of\npassenger\
  \ vehicles in the Greater Philadelphia region (or about 200,000\nvehicles) are PEVs.\n\
