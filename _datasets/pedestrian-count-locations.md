notes: 'DVRPC collects traffic volume counts at over 5,000 locations each year. The

  data is collected by the pneumatic tubes you see laying across the road. DVRPC

  also obtains traffic data collected by other entities and includes that data

  in its database as a public service. Traffic data is used by transportation

  engineers and planners, developers, market analysts, and may be of interest to

  the general public.
