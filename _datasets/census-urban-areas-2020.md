notes: 'This resource is a member of a series. The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related

  database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic

  information from the U.S. Census Bureau''s Master Address File / Topologically

  Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).

  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between

  parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an

  independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.


  After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that

  represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial,

  and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists

  of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a

  representation of the urban footprint. There are 2,646 Urban Areas (UAs) in

  this data release with either a minimum population of 5,000 or a housing unit

  count of 2,000 units. Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric

  census code that may contain leading zeroes.
