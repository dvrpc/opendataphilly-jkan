notes: 'Protected Open Space for the DVRPC Region as of 2016. DVRPC maintains an

  inventory of protected public and private open space in the Delaware Valley.

  The inventory tracks all publicly-owned open space, preserved farmland, and

  non profit protected open space. State, county and municipal programs preserve

  farms by purchasing development rights with public funds. Non-profits (land

  trusts and conservancies) protect privately owned open space lands by

  purchasing easements or by acquiring land outright with a combination of

  public and private funds. This file is a compilation from the following

  sources and is not necessarily parcel-based: Bucks County Planning Commission;

  Burlington County Department of Economic Development and Regional Planning;

  Camden County Division of Open Space and Farmland Preservation; Camden County

  Improvement Authority; Chester County Planning Commission; Delaware County

  Planning Department; Gloucester County Planning Division; Mercer County

  Planning Division; Montgomery County Planning Commission; Natural Lands Trust;

  New Jersey Conservation Foundation; New Jersey Department of Environmental

  Protection; New Jersey State Agriculture Development Committee; Pennsylvania

  Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; Philadelphia City Planning

  Commission; Philadelphia Department of Parks and Recreation In the cases where

  land had multiple owners, the following heirarchy was applied: 1. Preserved

  Farmland 2. Federal 3. State 4. County 5. Municipal 6. Nonprofit
