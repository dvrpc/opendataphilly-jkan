notes: "The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) established the Highway Safety\n\
  Improvement Program (HSIP) to achieve a significant reduction in traffic\nfatalities\
  \ and serious injuries on all public roads.\n\nThe HSIP emphasizes a data-driven,\
  \ strategic approach to improving highway\nsafety that focuses on results.\n\nUnder\
  \ the enabling transportation legislation enacted in December 2015, Fixing\nAmerica's\
  \ Surface Transportation (FAST), New Jersey receives approximately $57\nmillion\
  \ annually for safety improvements.\u201D\n\nThe HSIP requires a statewide strategic\
  \ highway safety plan to set goals and\nprioritize safety investments. The HSIP\
  \ also requires annual progress\nreporting to the FHWA.\n\n"
