notes: 'Every five years, since 1990, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission

  has produced a GIS Land Use layer for its 9-county region. As it was in 2000,

  digital orthophotography was flown by DVRPC in 2005. Digitizing was done using

  these 2005 true-color aerials on the ESRI ArcGIS software platform at a 1:2400

  (1 inch = 200 feet) scale.
