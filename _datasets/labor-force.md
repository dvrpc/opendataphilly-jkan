notes: "Labor force participation rate is a measure of the active workforce. It is\
  \ the\ntotal number of those employed or actively seeking employment divided by\
  \ the\nall working age population, however, from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American\n\
  Community Survey (ACS), the universe for the working age population considered\n\
  varies. For participation rates by sex, the population used is 20 to 64 years\n\
  old. For race and ethnic groupings, the age range is 16 and older. As a result\n\
  of the narrower age range the rates by sex are higher than those by race.\n\n"
