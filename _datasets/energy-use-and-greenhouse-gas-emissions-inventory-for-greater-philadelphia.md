notes: "Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory for Greater Philadelphia\n\
  \n[https://www.dvrpc.org/Products/18018](https://www.dvrpc.org/Products/18018)\n\
  \nEnergy Use is defined as the BBTU (Billion British Thermal Units) equivalent\n\
  of energy consumed by end point users. For electricity this is the BBTU\nequivalent\
  \ of the electricity at point of consumption, not the heat content of\nthe fuels\
  \ used for electricity generation.\n\nEmissions (MTCO2E - Metric tons of carbon\
  \ dioxide equivalent) from the\nfollowing sectors and fuel sources are not included\
  \ in this allocation:\nenteric fermentation and manure management; commerical and\
  \ general aviation;\nmarine and port-related activity; off-road vehicles and equipment;\
  \ freight and\nintercity passenger rail; coal; fuels used predominently in the industrial\n\
  sector (e.g., petroleum coke); and land use, land use change, and forestry.\n\n\
  Population and Employment data used in this analysis came from DVRPC's\nMunicipal-level\
  \ Poulation and Employment Forecasts.\n\n  * GEOID_10 - Unique GIS ID for Municipality.\n\
  \n  * ACRES - Total Municipal Acres.\n\n  * USEACRES - Energy Use per Acres (BBTUs).\n\
  \n  * EUPOPEM - Energy Use per Person/Job (BBTUs).\n\n  * EMIACRE - GHG Emissions\
  \ per Acre (MTCO2E).\n\n  * EMPOPE - GHG Emissions per Person/Job (MTCO2E).\n\n\
  \  * EMSQACRE - GHG Emissions/Sequestration including Land Use, Land Use Change,\
  \ and Foresty per Acres (MTCO2E).\n\n  * EMSQPOPE - GHG Emissions/Sequestration\
  \ including Land Use, Land Use Change, and Foresty per Person/Job (MTCO2E).\n\n\
  DVRPC estimates that net GHG emissions decreased 10 percent from 2010 to 2015,\n\
  from emissions equivalent to the release of 82 million metric tons of carbon\ndioxide\
  \ (MMTCO2e) to about 74 MMTCO2e. GHG emissions were 21 percent lower in\n2015 than\
  \ in 2005. The top three drivers of reductions between 2010 and 2015\nwere, in decreasing\
  \ levels of significance, change in electricity generation\nmix (a cleaner electricity\
  \ grid due to the continued switch from coal to\nnatural gas), decreased on-road\
  \ emissions per mile traveled, and decreased\nelectricity consumption per household.\
  \ Continued reductions will require\nsustained, concerted and aggressive action\
  \ at the household, firm, community,\nregional, state, national, and global level,\
  \ as well as continued technical\nadvancement. More information can be found at\n\
  www.dvrpc.org/EnergyClimate/Inventory.htm.\n\nPlease refer to DVRPC's Energy Use\
  \ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory for\nGreater Philadelphia: Methods and\
  \ Sources for further details on analysis\nmethods and data sources.\n\n[https://www.dvrpc.org/Products/TM18023](https://www.dvrpc.org/Products/TM18023)\n\
