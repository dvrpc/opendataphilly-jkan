notes: "As a part of DVRPC\u2019s long-range planning activities, the Commission is\n\
  required to maintain forecasts with at least a 20-year horizon, or to the\nhorizon\
  \ year of the long-range plan. Allocation of growth is forecasted using\na land\
  \ use model, UrbanSim, and working closely with member county planning\nstaffs.\
  \ DVRPC has prepared regional, county, and municipal-level population\nand employment\
  \ forecasts in five-year increments through 2050, using 2015\nCensus population\
  \ estimates and 2015 National Establishments Time Series\n(NETS) employment data\
  \ as the base. A forthcoming Analytical Data Report will\ndocument the forecasting\
  \ process and methodologies.\n\nWhile the forecast is not adopted at the transportation\
  \ analysis zone (TAZ)\nlevel, it is allocated to these zones for use in DVRPC\u2019\
  s travel demand model\nand conforms to municipal/district level adopted totals.\
  \ This data provides\nTAZ-level population and employment. Other travel model attributes\
  \ are\navailable upon request. Note: while 2019 land use model results are provided,\n\
  the forecast was only adopted for 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045,\nand\
  \ 2050.\n\n  \n\n"
