notes: 'Truck Parking facilities are essential to the freight system to accommodate

  overnight parking to support long haul truck movement in, out and through the

  region. In the DVRPC region there three types of truck parking facilities:

  private truck stops, service plazas, and rest areas. This data layer was

  assembled by DVRPC utilizing directory listing for these facilities and

  related property boundaries. Additional data was acquired through on site

  surveys of facilities.
