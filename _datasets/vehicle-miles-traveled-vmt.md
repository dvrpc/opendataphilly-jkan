notes: "Daily miles driven is a distance-based measure of all vehicle miles traveled\n\
  (VMT) on roadways for all motorized vehicle types\u2014auto, bus, motorcycle, and\n\
  truck\u2014on an average day. Per capita VMT is the same measure divided by the\n\
  same area's population for the same year. Per vehicle VMT divides VMT by the\nnumber\
  \ of household vehicles available by residents of that geography in the\nsame year.\
  \ Normalizing VMT by a county or the region's population or by\nhousehold vehicles\
  \ is helpful for context but does not have complete parity\nwith what is measured\
  \ in VMT estimates. People and vehicles come into the\nregion from other places,\
  \ just as people and vehicles leave the region to\nvisit other places. VMT per capita\
  \ compares all miles traveled on the region's\nroads to the region's population\
  \ (for all ages) from the U.S. Census Bureau's\nlatest population estimates. Vehicle\
  \ counts for VMT are classified by vehicle\ntypes but not by vehicle ownership.\n\
