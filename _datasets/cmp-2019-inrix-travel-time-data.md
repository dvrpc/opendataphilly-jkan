notes: "A CMP is a systematic process for managing congestion that provides\ninformation\
  \ on transportation system performance. It recommends a range of\nstrategies to\
  \ minimize congestion and enhance the mobility of people and\ngoods. These multimodal\
  \ strategies include, but are not limited to,\noperational improvements, travel\
  \ demand management, policy approaches, and\nadditions to capacity. The CMP advances\
  \ the goals of the DVRPC [Long-Range\nPlan](https://www.dvrpc.org/LongRangePlan/)\
  \ and strengthens the connection\nbetween the Plan and the [Transportation Improvement\
  \ Program\n(TIP)](https://www.dvrpc.org/TIP/).  \n  \nThe CMP, as included in current\
  \ federal transportation regulations, enhances\nthe existing concept of a Congestion\
  \ Management System (CMS) with emphasis on\nbeing an ongoing cycle and other refinements.\
  \ It identifies congested\ncorridors and multimodal strategies to mitigate the congestion.\
  \ Where more\nsingle-occupancy vehicle capacity is appropriate, the CMP includes\n\
  supplemental strategies to reduce travel demand and get the most value from\nthe\
  \ investment. It completes its cycle evaluating the effectiveness of\ntransportation\
  \ improvements, coordinating with other planning processes, and\nproviding updated\
  \ analysis of the performance of the transportation system as\nit goes back around.\
  \  \n\n[Click Here](https://www.dvrpc.org/CongestionManagement/) to read more about\n\
  the CMP and view the latest publications.\n\n"
