notes: 'National Highway System (NHS) connectors are roads, which may be either state

  or locally owned, which connect intermodal facilities to major highways on the

  National Highway System. The NHS Connectors in this data layer are officially

  designated NHS freight connectors that serve any of three types of facilities:

  intermodal rail facility, port, and/or airport. These routes were digitized

  based on DVRPC''s street centerline data set to correspond with the officially

  designated NHS Connector routes.
