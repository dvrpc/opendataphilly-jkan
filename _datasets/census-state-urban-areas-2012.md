notes: 'The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract
  of

  selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau''s

  Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and

  Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless

  national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line

  shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can

  be combined to cover the entire nation. After each decennial census, the

  Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed

  territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential

  urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high

  population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the

  "urban footprint." There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs)

  that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at

  least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin

  Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater

  than 50,000). Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census

  code that may contain leading zeroes.
