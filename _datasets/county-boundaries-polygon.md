notes: 'County boundaries for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, New York,

  Connecticut, and the District of Columbia. Original Sources: PA - PennDOT NJ -

  NJOIT DE - DE Geological Survey MD, NY, CT, DC - ESRI Linework has been

  adjusted using the following methodology. NJ''s boundaries overrode PA, since

  NJ''s were highly accurate. PA overrode MD since PennDOT''s were more accurate

  than ESRI''s, and DE overrode PA & MD, since the "arc" of northernmost DE was a

  bit more accurate than PennDOT''s or our original county boundaries. County

  boundaries in the DVRPC region have been adjusted to align with parcel data

  (where appropriate). NOTE: Use the following definition query if only need one

  county in DVRPC Region "Co_Name" LIKE ''%Bucks%''
