notes: 'The pipelines shapefile was digitized from Ai graphic files, where individual

  lines were traced from PDFs of individual county maps provided by the National

  Pipeline Mapping System(NPMS). Due to the sensitive nature of this data, the

  maps that were made available through NPMS are not precisely accurate and are

  intended for use at a county or regional scale.
