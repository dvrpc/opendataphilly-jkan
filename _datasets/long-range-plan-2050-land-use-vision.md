notes: "LAND USE VISION\n\nThe Connections 2050 Land Use Vision defines a regional\
  \ visualization for\nCenters-based development and the preservation of agricultural\
  \ and natural\nlands. The Land Use Vision divides the entire region up into four\
  \ layers:\nInfill and Redevelopment areas, Emerging Growth areas, Rural Resource\
  \ Lands,\nand the Greenspace Network. Overlaid on these land use areas are over\
  \ 125\nCenters, which are points of more concentrated development around which new\n\
  development should be focused.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE: GEOGRAPHY IS FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES\
  \ ONLY AND IS DESIGNED TO\nBE USED AT THE DVRPC REGIONAL SCALE ONLY**\n\nAll Connections\
  \ 2050 Long-Range Plan elements are available online at\nwww.dvrpc.org/plan. The\
  \ Plan has two primary documents: (1) The Connections\n2050 Policy Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21027)\
  \ identifies the vision,\ngoals, strategies, and a summary of the financial plan.\
  \ (2) The Connections\n2050 Process and Analysis Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21028)\
  \ provides a\nmore detailed look at the Plan\u2019s outreach, background information,\
  \ analysis,\nand financial plan.\n\n"
