notes: "Both the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and the Pennsylvania\n\
  Department of Transportation (PennDOT) track pavement conditions as required\nby\
  \ federal regulations for state-maintained and National Highway System (NHS)\nroadways.\
  \ NJDOT and PennDOT maintain data on the condition of all federal- and\nstate-owned\
  \ roadways. States and the Federal Highway Administration use a\nnumber of different\
  \ methodologies for classifying pavement conditions. A\ncommon measure of road condition\
  \ is the International Roughness Index (IRI).\nThe IRI determines pavement roughness\
  \ conditions based on total inches of\nsurface variation per mile. IRI is one of\
  \ the pavement condition measurements\nthat PennDOT uses. New Jersey integrates\
  \ two condition measures, IRI and its\nSurface Distress Index (SDI), into condition\
  \ ratings. SDI was developed by\nNJDOT based on the size of cracks, holes, and ruts\
  \ in a roadway. Therefore,\nwhen segment miles (see below) or percentage of segment\
  \ miles are added up for\nthe region, note that these are aggregations combining\
  \ two different\nclassification methods. Segment miles are used in the pavement\
  \ conditions\ngraphs, as both states provide data to calculate this metric. Segment\
  \ miles\nmeasure the roadway length. Length is doubled for divided facilities. Unlike\n\
  lane miles which fully account for pavement width, segment miles\nunderrepresent\
  \ the pavement conditions of wider roads and highways, with more\nlanes. About 4,200\
  \ segment miles of road are tracked in Pennsylvania and about\n1,600 are tracked\
  \ in New Jersey. These roads are primarily those owned and\nmaintained by each state\
  \ DOT, though they include some locally maintained\nroads that are a part of the\
  \ National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a\nfederally designated network of roadways\
  \ important to the nation\u2019s economy,\ndefense, and mobility. Section 1104 of\
  \ the Moving Ahead for Progress in the\n21st Century Act (MAP-21) expanded the NH)\
  \ by including all principal\narterials in existence on October 1, 2012. adding\
  \ 60,000 miles to the NHS.\nThis is the reason for the increase in NHS segment miles\
  \ in 2013 in the charts\nbelow, along with the decrease in non-NHS segment miles.\n\
