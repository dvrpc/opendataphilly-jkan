- description: 'County Planning Areas (CPAs) are relatively large subcounty geographies
    used

    for generalized display or analysis within the region. In the travel model,

    CPAs are referred to as Districts. CPAs are created in two ways, depending on

    the county they''re in. For Philadelphia, CPAs are the same as the 18

    Philadelphia Planning Districts. In the surrounding 8 counties, CPAs are

    aggregations of adjacent municipalities (MCDs). The first digit of the CPA_ID

    references its county. The following is a list of the leading digit in the

    CPA_ID followed by the county name and then a count of CPAs within the county

    in brackets []. 1 Philadelphia County, PA [18] 2 Delaware County, PA [6] 3
