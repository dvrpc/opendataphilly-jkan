notes: 'The dataset is an update of a feature class representing four different

  Pinelands boundaries in Southern New Jersey. It represents the Pinelands

  Preservation Area District and the Pinelands Protection Area as per the New

  Jersey Pinelands Protection Act of 1979 (P.L. 1979, Chapter 111, approved June

  28, 1979), the Pinelands Comprehensive Management Plan area (N.J.S.A. 13:18A-1

  et. seq.), and the Pinelands National Reserve boundary as per the National

  Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-625, Sec. 502). Originally the

  dataset was created manually by interpreting text documents which described

  the boundary lines and drafting this information onto mylar using USGS photo

  quads as a base. In 1994, the coverage was digitized and converted to New

  Jersey State Plane NAD 83 Feet. In 2002, the boundaries were adjusted to a

  seamless parcel layer. In 2014/15 the boundaries were adjusted to The State of

  New Jersey Composite of Parcels Data layer developed by the New Jersey Office

  of Information Technology and an updated Pinelands Management Area layer to

  make the lines coincidental where applicable. The composite parcel layer is

  "In work", so changes made in the composite parcel layer after the release of

  this data set will not be reflected in this version. The boundaries are

  intended to provide reasonable representation of the boundaries for planning

  purposes. They are not survey grade. The current geometry is not static and is

  prone to change.
