notes: "PLANNING AREAS\n\nAll Connections 2050 Long-Range Plan elements are available\
  \ online at\nwww.dvrpc.org/plan. The Plan has two primary documents:\n\n(1) The\
  \ Connections 2050 Policy Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21027)\nidentifies the\
  \ vision, goals, strategies, and a summary of the financial plan.\n\n(2) The Connections\
  \ 2050 Process and Analysis Manual\n(www.dvrpc.org/Products/21028) provides a more\
  \ detailed look at the Plan\u2019s\noutreach, background information, analysis,\
  \ and financial plan.\n\nGreater Philadelphia is a complex mosaic of 352 diverse\
  \ cities, boroughs, and\ntownships. The Connections 2045 Long-Range Plan characterizes\
  \ each of the\nregion\u2019s municipalities as either a Core City, Developed Community,\
  \ Growing\nSuburb, or Rural Area, as a means of categorizing the types of communities\
  \ and\ndefining the corresponding long-range planning policies most appropriate\
  \ for\neach type. This categorization is shown on the Planning Areas and Centers\n\
  dataset.\n\nMany municipalities have areas within their boundaries that fit the\n\
  characteristics of more than one of these Planning Area types. Gloucester\nTownship\
  \ (in Camden County, New Jersey), for example, has neighborhoods that\nare fully\
  \ developed, but it also has a significant number of undeveloped acres\nand forecasted\
  \ population and employment growth more characteristic of a\nGrowing Suburb. The\
  \ intent of the Plan is to assign to each municipality the\nplanning area type associated\
  \ with the long-range planning policies that will\nbe most beneficial to the entire\
  \ community. While the Planning Areas and\nCenters map is a guide for policy direction\
  \ at the regional scale, actual\napproaches should always be guided by local conditions.\n\
  \nThe region\u2019s four Core Cities are Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester.\n\
  Targeted infrastructure investment, maintenance and rehabilitation,\ncomprehensive\
  \ neighborhood revitalization, and efforts focused on reinforcing\na network of\
  \ social and educational programs will help to rebuild and\nrevitalize the region\u2019\
  s cities.\n\nDeveloped Communities are places that have already experienced most\
  \ of their\npopulation and employment growth, and include inner ring communities\
  \ adjacent\nto the Core Cities; railroad boroughs and trolley car communities; and\
  \ mature\nsuburban townships. Many of these communities are stable and thriving,\n\
  offering affordable housing opportunities; access to transit; safe pedestrian\n\
  and bicycling environments; and a strong community identity. Others, however,\n\
  are experiencing population and employment losses; have deteriorating\ninfrastructure\
  \ systems; have aging resident populations living on limited\nincomes; and have\
  \ stagnant or declining tax bases that cannot keep pace with\nrising service demands.\
  \ Rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure\nsystems and the housing stock,\
  \ and local economic and community development\ncan help to reinforce location advantages,\
  \ while stabilizing neighborhoods and\nstemming decline.\n\nGrowing Suburbs are\
  \ communities that have a significant number of developable\nacres remaining and\
  \ are experiencing or are forecast to experience significant\npopulation and/or\
  \ employment growth. Key planning policies in these\ncommunities focus on the need\
  \ to improve the form of development, reduce\ncongestion, and mitigate the negative\
  \ consequences of unmanaged growth, and\ninclude growth management and enhanced\
  \ community design. Smart growth\ntechniques that support a more concentrated development\
  \ pattern (such as\nclustering, mixed uses, transit-oriented development, and transfer\
  \ of\ndevelopment rights) can provide the critical mass necessary to support new\n\
  transit services and other alternatives to the automobile. The quality of\ndesign\
  \ and architectural character of the built environment, open space\npreservation,\
  \ and the creation of an integrated system of open space and\nrecreation are all\
  \ priorities in these communities.\n\nRural Areas include the region\u2019s agricultural\
  \ communities and communities with\nlarge remaining natural areas. Key policy approaches\
  \ for these communities\nfocus on preservation and limiting development, and include\
  \ limited expansion\nof infrastructure systems, preservation of a rural lifestyle\
  \ and village\ncharacter, support for continued farming, and enhanced natural resource\n\
  protection. Livable communities in these areas include rural centers that have\n\
  an identi fi able main street, a mix of uses, higher densities than their\nsurrounding\
  \ uses, and a true sense of place.\n\n"
