notes: 'The region''s transit agencies report transit fleet conditions to the Federa

  Transit Administration''s (FTA) National Transit Database (NTB), by either rail

  vehicle or bus. Rail vehicles include light rail and trolleys, heavy rail

  (i.e., subway), and regional rail passenger cars and locomotives. Four

  different agencies provide transit service to the region. SEPTA provides bus

  and rail service to all five southeastern Pennsylvania counties and has

  several commuter rail lines that terminate outside this service area, in New

  Castle County, Delaware; and Mercer County, New Jersey. The Port Authority

  Transit Corporation (PATCO) operates a passenger rail line connecting

  Philadelphia with Camden County. New Jersey Transit (NJ Transit) runs buses

  throughout the four southern New Jersey counties and into Philadelphia and has

  three rail lines in the region: a light rail connecting Camden and Mercer

  counties, and two commuter rail lines connecting Philadelphia and Atlantic

  City and Mercer County to New York City. Finally, Pottstown Area Rapid Transit

  (PART) provides bus service throughout Pottstown and into several neighboring

  municipalities in Montgomery and Chester counties.
