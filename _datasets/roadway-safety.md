notes: 'People killed or seriously injured (KSI) is used as the metric for roadway

  safety rather than simply fatalities because fatalities alone tend to be

  random in nature and can obscure long-term trends. Including serious injuries

  makes the data more robust and better highlights how the region is doing at

  preventing serious vehicle crashes. This approach has been promoted by the

  FHWA and embraced by both NJDOT and PennDOT. Because KSI can fluctuate from

  year to year, five-year rolling averages are used to identify trends, as seen

  in the first chart. The data separates pedestrians and bicyclists from motor

  vehicle occupants because these users are more vulnerable to death or serious

  injury when involved in a crash. Data for motor vehicle and combined bicyclist

  and pedestrian KSI u KSI can be looked at as a raw total, normalized based on

  population (per capita), or based on vehicle miles driven (per VMT).
