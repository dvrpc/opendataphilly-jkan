notes: 'The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that
  are

  an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S.

  Census Bureau''s Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic

  Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a

  seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each

  TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they

  can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of

  most States are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as

  parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the

  organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the

  unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for

  statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four

  States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more

  incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus

  constitute primary divisions of their States. These incorporated places are

  known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for

  purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no

  primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for

  purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities

  as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in

  Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the

  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin

  Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island

  Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities. The 2010 Census

  boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2010,

  primarily as reported through the Census Bureau''s Boundary and Annexation

  Survey (BAS).
