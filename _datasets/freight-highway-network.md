notes: 'The DVRPC Freight Highways data layer was based on DVRPC''s major routes

  dataset representing major highways in the region. The dataset uses the

  centerlines of undivided highway segments and ramps to depict each of the

  major freight serving highways as identified by DVRPC staff. The highways are

  limited to regional serving routes including interstates and limited-access

  highways. This dataset is mapped by route name number and is segmented at key

  interchanges and by several characteristics: road profile, V/C ratio and

  performance indicators.
