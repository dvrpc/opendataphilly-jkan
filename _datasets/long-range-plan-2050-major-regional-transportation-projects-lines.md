notes: "MAJOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS (LINES) - Updated 2/2022\n\nAll Connections\
  \ 2050 Long-Range Plan elements are available online at\nwww.dvrpc.org/plan. The\
  \ Plan has two primary documents:\n\n(1) The Connections 2050 Policy Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21027)\n\
  identifies the vision, goals, strategies, and a summary of the financial plan.\n\
  \n(2) The Connections 2050 Process and Analysis Manual\n(www.dvrpc.org/Products/21028)\
  \ provides a more detailed look at the Plan\u2019s\noutreach, background information,\
  \ analysis, and financial plan.\n\nMajor Regional Projects are large-scale projects\
  \ that will have a significant\nimpact on regional travel. Almost all system expansion\
  \ projects are Major\nRegional Projects, as are reconstruction projects on the region\u2019\
  s freeways.\nMajor Operational Improvement initiatives are also listed in the Plan.\
  \ For the\nsake of brevity, smaller-scale projects that were identified in the needs\n\
  assessment are not listed in the Plan document. Instead, the various funding\ncategories\
  \ in the Plan serve as placeholders for their funding, and they may\nbe explicitly\
  \ listed in future iterations of the TIP.\n\n"
