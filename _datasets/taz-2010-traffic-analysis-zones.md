notes: 'The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that
  are

  an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S.

  Census Bureau''s Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic

  Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a

  seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each

  TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they

  can be combined to cover the entire nation. Traffic analysis zones (TAZs) are

  basic spatial units of analysis facilitating the ability of transportation

  planners to forecast changes in commuting patterns, trip volumes, and modes of

  travel, and to develop plans to meet the changing demands for transportation

  facilities and capacities. Each TAZ represents an area containing similar

  kinds of land use and commuter travel.
