  \ produced this Limited-English Proficiency Plan.\nThis is the data that was used\
  \ to make the maps for the upcoming plan.\n\nCensus tables used to gather data from\
  \ the 2015- 2019 American Community\nSurvey 5-Year Estimates\n\nACS 2015-2019, Table\
  \ C16001: Language Spoken at Home by Ability to Speak\nEnglish for the Population\
