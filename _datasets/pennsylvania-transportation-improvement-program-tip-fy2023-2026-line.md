notes: 'The [Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)](https://www.dvrpc.org/tip/)
  is

  the regionally agreed-upon list of priority transportation projects, as

  required by federal law (ISTEA, TEA-21, SAFETEA LU, MAP-21, and the FAST Act).

  The TIP document must list all projects that intend to use federal funds,

  along with all non-federally funded projects that are regionally significant.

  We also include all other State funded capital projects. The projects are

  multi-modal; that is, they include bicycle, pedestrian, ITS, and freight

  related projects, as well as the more traditional highway and public transit

  projects.


  The DVRPC FY2023 TIP for PA (FY23-FY26) was adopted by the DVRPC Board on

  ________, and is in effect from ________ to ________. This important document

  catalogs the latest program of transportation projects for the Pennsylvania

  counties in the bi- state region.


  Please note that not all TIP projects are able to be mapped.
