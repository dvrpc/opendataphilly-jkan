notes: "This dataset contains data from the P.L. 94-171 2020 Census Redistricting\n\
  Program. The 2020 Census Redistricting Data Program provides states the\nopportunity\
  \ to delineate voting districts and to suggest census block\nboundaries for use\
  \ in the 2020 Census redistricting data tabulations (Public\nLaw 94-171 Redistricting\
  \ Data File). In addition, the Redistricting Data\nProgram will periodically collect\
  \ state legislative and congressional district\nboundaries if they are changed by\
  \ the states. The program is also responsible\nfor the effective delivery of the\
  \ 2020 Census P.L. 94-171 Redistricting Data\nstatutorily required by one year from\
  \ Census Day. The program ensures\ncontinued dialogue with the states in regard\
  \ to 2020 Census planning, thereby\nallowing states ample time for their planning,\
  \ response, and participation.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau will deliver the Public Law\
  \ 94-171 redistricting data\nto all states by Sept. 30, 2021. COVID-19-related delays\
  \ and prioritizing the\ndelivery of the apportionment results delayed the Census\
  \ Bureau\u2019s original\nplan to deliver the redistricting data to the states by\
  \ April 1, 2021. Data in\nthis dataset contains information on population, diversity,\
  \ race, ethnicity,\nhousing, household, vacancy rate for 2020 for various geographies\
  \ (county,\nMCD, Philadelphia Planning Districts (referred to as county planning\
  \ areas\n[CPAs] internally, Census designated places, tracts, block groups, and\
  \ blocks)\nFor more information on the 2020 Census, visit\nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-\n\
  files.html **PLEASE NOTE: 2020 Decennial Census data has had noise injected\ninto\
  \ it because of the Census's new Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS). This\ncan mean\
  \ that population counts and characteristics, especially when they are\nparticularly\
  \ small, may not exactly correspond to the data as collected. As\nsuch, caution\
  \ should be exercised when examining areas with small counts. Ron\nJarmin, acting\
  \ director of the Census Bureau posted a discussion of the\nredistricting data,\
  \ which outlines what to expect with the new DAS. For more\ndetails on accuracy\
  \ you can read it here:\nhttps://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/director/2021/07/redistricting-\n\
