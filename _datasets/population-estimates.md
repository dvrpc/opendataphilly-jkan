notes: 'The U.S. Census Bureau releases annual estimates of population by counties
  and

  municipalities as part of the Population Estimates Program (PEP). This is an

  estimate of population on July 1 of each year. Adjustments to previous

  estimate years are made with each release, dating back to the year of the last

  decennial census. Decennial figures for April 1 of the most recent decennial

  year will not get updated, but the July 1 estimate for that same year can

  adjust with each PEP release. The U.S. Census Bureau produces these estimates

  based on administrative records. At the municipal level, the PEP reports only

  population totals. At the county level, PEP data gives estimates for age, sex,

  race, and ethnicity. PEP releases come out in the spring following the latest

  estimate year. The demographic estimates of the PEP are used as control totals

  for the American Community Survey results released later that year.
