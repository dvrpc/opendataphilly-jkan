notes: "Current (2021) and projected numbers of Plug-in Electrical Vehicles (PEVs)\
  \ at\nthe census block group level for the Delaware Valley region. The projected\
  \ PEV\ndistribution is based on a scenario in which 5 percent of passenger vehicles\n\
  in the Greater Philadelphia region (or about 200,000 vehicles) are PEVs.\n\nAlso\
  \ includes data projecting workplace charging demand in number of charging\nevents\
  \ and kilowatt-hours of demand by census block group based on the\naforementioned\
  \ PEV projections for the following three scenarios:\n\n  1. \\- workplace charging\
  \ is free (free charging), \n\n  2. \\- workplace charging is twice the cost of\
  \ home charging (paid charging). \n\n  3. \n\nThe following datasets were used to\
  \ obtain these results using the EV Planning\nToolkit:\n\n  * \\- 2021 vehicle registration\
  \ data provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation\n\n  * \\- 2021\
  \ vehicle registration data from the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission provided\
  \ by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection\n\n  * \\- [2015-2019\
  \ American Community Survey 5-year Estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)\n\
  \n  * \\- [LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), version 7](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/)\n\
  \n  * \\- Block group-to-block group commuting distances from DVRPC's Travel Improvement\
  \ Model 2.1, accessed December 2017.\n\n  * \\- Block group-to-block group commuting\
  \ distances calculated from Esri\u2019s ArcGIS Network Analyst, used in 2017.\n\n\
