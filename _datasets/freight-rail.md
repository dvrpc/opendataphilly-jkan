notes: 'The DVRPC Freight Rail Line data layer was developed to identify key ownership

  and operation details for freight rail lines in the Delaware Valley. This data

  set was developed internally using various rail mapping and track chart

  sources. The polyline network represents rights-of-way rather than track and

  is segmented based on subdivision or track name as well as key profile

  details. The line set has been developed with input from various Class I and

  short-line railroads in the region.
