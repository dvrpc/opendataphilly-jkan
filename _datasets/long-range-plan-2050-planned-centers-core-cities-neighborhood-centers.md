notes: "PLANNED CENTERS, CORE CITIES & NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS\n\nAll Connections 2050\
  \ Long-Range Plan elements are available online at\nwww.dvrpc.org/plan. The Plan\
  \ has two primary documents:\n\n(1) The Connections 2050 Policy Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21027)\n\
  identifies the vision, goals, strategies, and a summary of the financial plan.\n\
  \n(2) The Connections 2050 Process and Analysis Manual\n(www.dvrpc.org/Products/21028)\
  \ provides a more detailed look at the Plan\u2019s\noutreach, background information,\
  \ analysis, and financial plan.\n\nThe concept of Centers is the cornerstone of\
  \ the Connections 2050 Long-Range\nPlan. Centers provide a focal point in the regional\
  \ landscape that recognizes\nthe regional and local significance of places, while\
  \ reinforcing a sense of\ncommunity for local residents. Centers serve as a basis\
  \ for organizing and\nfocusing the development landscape and provide a framework\
  \ for the most\nefficient provision of supportive infrastructure systems, including\
  \ water,\nsewer, and transportation. By concentrating growth around and within Centers,\n\
  the region can both preserve open space and reduce infrastructure costs. The\ndensities\
  \ and mixed uses inherent within Centers can enhance the feasibility\nof walking,\
  \ bicycling, and public transit as alternatives to the automobile.\n\n"
