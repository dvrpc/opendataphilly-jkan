notes: "FREIGHT CENTERS\n\nAll Connections 2050 Long-Range Plan elements are available\
  \ online at\nwww.dvrpc.org/plan. The Plan has two primary documents:\n\n(1) The\
  \ Connections 2050 Policy Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21027)\nidentifies the\
  \ vision, goals, strategies, and a summary of the financial plan.\n\n(2) The Connections\
  \ 2050 Process and Analysis Manual\n(www.dvrpc.org/Products/21028) provides a more\
  \ detailed look at the Plan\u2019s\noutreach, background information, analysis,\
  \ and financial plan.\n\nGreater Philadelphia has 67 identified \u201CFreight Centers,\u201D\
  \ which are major\nfocal points and trip generators. The Freight Centers are a testament\
  \ to the\nbroad range of manufacturing, warehousing, transportation, quarry, and\
  \ utility\nactivity that occurs locally. They also highlight the strong linkage\
  \ between\nfreight transportation and job retention and creation.\n\n"
