notes: "Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) is a road classification technique based on\
  \ the\ncomfort of bicyclists in the traffic stream. One commonly used LTS framework\n\
  ranges from LTS 1 to LTS 4, classifying road segments that would be\ncomfortable\
  \ for any bicyclist to segments that only the fearless would brave\non a bicycle,\
  \ respectively. Over the past several years, a variety of papers\nhave been written\
  \ about different methods for assigning LTS values to road\nsegments and how these\
  \ LTS values have been used to inform planning and\ninfrastructure decisions through\
  \ connectivity analysis. Since demand modeling\nfor bicycling is absent from many\
  \ regional travel demand models (including\nDVRPC\u2019s), a measure of the potential\
  \ use of a bicycle facility is difficult to\nobtain. Instead of focusing on demand,\
  \ bicycle network connectivity is often\nused as an accessibility metric. Much of\
  \ the connectivity analysis in prior\nresearch compared existing conditions to a\
  \ \u201Cbike-plan buildout\u201D scenario, or\nsimilar, to compare project merits.\
  \ This project, instead, provides an example\nof a different type of LTS and network\
  \ connectivity application.  \n\n  \n\nFor detailed information about the data in\
  \ this layer please goto the [DVRPC\nBicycle LTS and Connectivity Analysis\nDocumentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ye_lo7LQjgon1F6_AxIb70nmpuOercXk/view)\n\
