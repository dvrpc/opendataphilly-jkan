notes: 'DVRPC has tracked regional land use changes and the preservation of land for

  decades. Since 1970, DVRPC has produced land use files derived from aerial

  photography in our nine-county region. Starting in 1990, these digital land

  use files have been produced every five years using Computer Assisted Mapping

  and Geographic Information Systems software. Methods and technology were

  updated for the 2000 inventory and subsequent releases. Although reasonable

  comparisons can be drawn between DVRPC''s land use files produced in 2005 or

  later, users should be cautious when comparing these later files to earlier

  land use data, particularly within specific developed land use categories

  and/or specific municipalities. DVRPC also maintains an inventory of protected

  public and private open space in the region. The inventory tracks all publicly

  owned open space, and preserved farmland and nonprofit-protected open space

  (both of which are typically still owned by private landowners). States,

  counties, municipalities, and nonprofits (such as land trusts and

  conservancies) may purchase a parcel of land outright for preservation or

  purchase the development rights to the parcel. Purchase of development rights

  is common for farmland, enabling the farmer landowner to continue working on

  the land. Outright purchase of the parcel (not just development rights but

  full ownership of the parcel) can be accomplished by both public and private

  entities. Funding sources for land conservation vary, but public entities

  typically use tax funds, while nonprofits may use a combination of public and

  private sources, including income and estate tax deductions.
