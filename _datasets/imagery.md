notes: 'Aerial imagery is an essential tool for planning and analysis. It presents
  a

  comprehensive view of regional conditions. Having access to aerial imagery

  from various years provides the user with a chronological record of land use

  patterns. Aerials have been an important component of DVRPC''s planning efforts

  for many years. They are also a popular source of information for consultants,

  developers, engineers, realtors, and the general public. Orthoimagery consists

  of rectified or geometrically corrected aerial images that have been processed

  so that any distortions stemming from topographic relief and camera position

  are removed. This results in an accurate representation of the Earth''s

  surface. Due to its uniform scale, distances between features can be measured

  on an orthoimage. Where these features touch the ground, they are shown in

  their true x and y map position. ## Available for the years 2000 through 2020

  in five-year increments * Covers the entire 3,833 square mile DVRPC 9-county

  region (Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties in

  Pennsylvania and Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Mercer counties in New

  Jersey) * The 2000 orthoimagery is grayscale with a 1.5 sq. ft. pixel

  resolution, a horizontal positional accuracy of +/-5'', and a design scale of

  1" = 200'' * The 2005 and 2010 orthoimagery is 3-band, natural color, with a 1

  sq. ft. pixel resolution, a horizontal positional accuracy of +/-5'', and a

  design scale of 1" = 200'' * The 2015 orthoimagery is 4-band (allows for

  display in either natural color or color infrared) with a 1 sq. ft. pixel

  resolution, a horizontal positional accuracy of +/-5'', and a design scale of

  1" = 200'' * The 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 orthoimagery tiles are referenced to

  their respective State Plane map coordinate system (either NJ State Plane

  NAD83 or PA State Plane South Zone NAD83) * Each orthoimagery tile covers

  approximately 1.6 square miles of land area; Using Geographic Information

  System (GIS) software, individual tiles can be viewed together as a seamless

  mosaic of a larger area * The 2020 orthoimagery is 3-band, natural color with

  a 1 sq. ft. pixel resolution, a horizontal positional accuracy of +/-5'', and a

  design scale of 1" = 200''; Available as county mosaics in JPEG 2000 format

  referenced to UTM Zone 18N - NAD83 (2011)

    indexes.

    These indexes define the overall extent of the imagery and assist users in

    locating the particular images of interest to them. Indexes for both DVRPC''s

    historical aerial imagery (1959 and 1965-1995) and NJ/PA orthoimagery

    (2000-2015) are included. __PLEASE NOTE:__ This aerial imagery index viewer

    utilizes Google''s basemap layers. Therefore, the imagery shown within the

    viewer is __not__ DVRPC imagery. The Google imagery is utilized simply as a

    reference to assist the user in locating his or her area of interest.
