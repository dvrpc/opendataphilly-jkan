notes: "DVRPC tracks transit ridership in the region through unlinked passenger trips,\n\
  with data provided by each of the region's four transit operators\u2014Southeastern\n\
  Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), New Jersey Transit (NJ\nTransit),\
  \ Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO), and Pottstown Area Rapid\nTransit\
  \ (PART)\u2014to the National Transit Database (NTD). Unlinked passenger\ntrips\
  \ count each passenger boarding, regardless of fare paid. Thus, a trip\nwith a transfer\
  \ would count as two boardings. Transit ridership does not\ninclude Amtrak, shuttles,\
  \ or private bus passengers. It also does not include\nservices that receive partial\
  \ funding from SEPTA like SCCOOT and Krapf's \"A\"\nBus.\n\n"
