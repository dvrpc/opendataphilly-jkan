notes: "The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) has conducted\naircraft\
  \ operations counts at the non-towered airports in the 12-county, four-\nstate Delaware\
  \ Valley Regional Airport System Plan (RASP) area since 1986.\nAircraft operations\
  \ counts and annual estimates of activity are essential for\nplanning and programming\
  \ of airport improvements. While towered airports\ngenerally have access to this\
  \ information through air traffic controllers, the\ngeneral aviation and reliever\
  \ airports that make up the majority of facilities\nin the region rely primarily\
  \ on estimates for their traffic data. DVRPC\u2019s\ncyclical aircraft operations\
  \ counting program focuses on the counting of non-\ntowered National Plan of Integrated\
  \ Airport Systems (NPIAS) airports and is\nmade possible by funding through the\
  \ Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\nThe regional NPIAS airports are counted\
  \ in a three-year program. The resulting\naviation operations data created from\
  \ these annual counting cycles provides\nfacility-level details on based aircraft;\
  \ estimated average daily, seasonal,\nand annual fixed-wing operations; and helicopter\
  \ activity estimates.\n\n"
