notes: 'A CMP is a systematic process for managing congestion that provides

  information on transportation system performance. It recommends a range of

  strategies to minimize congestion and enhance the mobility of people and

  goods. These multimodal strategies include, but are not limited to,

  operational improvements, travel demand management, policy approaches, and

  additions to capacity. The CMP advances the goals of the DVRPC Long-Range Plan

  and strengthens the connection between the Plan and the Transportation

  Improvement Program (TIP).
