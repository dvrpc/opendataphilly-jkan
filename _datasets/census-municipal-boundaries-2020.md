notes: 'The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract
  of

  selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau''s

  Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and

  Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless

  national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line

  shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can

  be combined to cover the entire nation.


  Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a

  county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of

  the 2020 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau

  delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed

  or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary

  purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for

  the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial

  censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and

  8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated,

  census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population

  characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of

  census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical

  changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development,

  and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts

  occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of

  substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow

  visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as

  minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and

  situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where

  the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State

  and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard

  census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may

  consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the

  census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are

  themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of

  9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority

  American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was

  primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or

  off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for

  those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a

  relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military

  installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through

  9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no

  land area.
