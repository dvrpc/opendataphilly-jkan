notes: 'The points in this layer represent the location of public airports and select

  heliports in DVRPC''s 28-County Data Service Area.


  Attribute fields titled "RASP" and "RASP_Type" were included to indicate

  whether an airport is part of DVRPC''s Regional Airport System Plan (RASP). The

  RASP currently contains 24 airports: 3 commercial, 10 reliever, and 11 general

  aviation or recreational facilities. In addition, the current RASP identifies

  three operating public use heliports and one military airbase. The "DVRPC_REG"

  field indicates whether a facility is within the DVRPC 9-county region.


  Additional attribute data pertaining to these facilities may be sourced from

  the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA provides airport data for

  the entire United States via various downloadable tables:
