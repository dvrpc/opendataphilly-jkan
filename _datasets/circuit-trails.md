notes: "Greater Philadelphia is a region blessed with a variety of opportunities to\n\
  create a connected network of multi-use trails, including both right-of-ways\n(ROWs)\
  \ inherited from the area's long history as a hub of railroad activity\nand greenway\
  \ corridors that follow the region's creek buffering and park\nsystems. Some of\
  \ these opportunities have been capitalized upon\u2014a number of\nsignificant trail\
  \ segments already exist or are currently moving toward\nconstruction\u2014but \"\
  gaps\" still exist. In May 2012, DVRPC Board Member Terence\nFarrell and DVRPC Executive\
  \ Director Barry Seymour joined Philadelphia Mayor\nMichael Nutter to celebrate\
  \ the efforts of foundations, governments, non-\nprofits, economic development professionals,\
  \ and numerous other groups to fill\nthese gaps and create an interconnected network\
  \ of multi-use trails called The\nCircuit.\n\n"
