notes: 'Land use totals for the Greater Philadelphia region, in five-years increments

  from 1990 to 2015. Data is derived from the corresponding year''s Land Use GIS

  dataset, created by DVRPC. Please note that DVRPC has altered our data

  creation methodology over time, as technology, processes, and higher

  resolution orthoimagery have become available. As such, you''ll find that land

  use categories in different tables do not always completely correlate to one

  another. For example, in 2015, DVRPC created more detailed land use

  classifications, making comparisons with previous datasets problematic. For

  more information, please visit our publication ["Land Use in the Delaware

  Valley, 2015 Enhanced Land Use Data" (ADR

  026).](https://www.dvrpc.org/Reports/ADR026.pdf)
