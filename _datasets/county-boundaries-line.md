notes: 'Linear county boundaries for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
  New

  York, Connecticut, and the District of Columbia. Original Sources: PA -

  PennDOT NJ - NJOIT DE - DE Geological Survey MD, NY, CT, DC - ESRI Linework

  has been adjusted using the following methodology. NJ''s boundaries overrode

  PA, since NJ''s were highly accurate. PA overrode MD since PennDOT''s were more

  accurate than ESRI''s, and DE overrode PA & MD, since the "arc" of northernmost

  DE was a bit more accurate than PennDOT''s or our original county boundaries.

  County boundaries in the DVRPC region have been adjusted to align with parcel

  data (where appropriate). NOTE: Use the following definition query if only

  need one county in DVRPC Region "Co_Name" LIKE ''%Bucks%''
