  The Legislative District polygon spatial layer delineates the legislative

  districts for New Jersey, beginning with the elections of 2023; the

  individuals elected will take office in January, 2024. The timing of this New

  Jersey redistricting was delayed due to the COVID19 pandemic. The spatial data

  are based mainly on the NJ Municipal Boundaries layer Govt_admin_municipal_bnd

  (fka nj_munis), rather than Census Bureau geographic data (TIGER.) Information

  on officeholders is derived from the legislative roster provided by the NJ

  Office of Legislative Services. It is updated infrequently and should be

  checked from an independent source before use. ***NOTE*** For users who

  incorporate NJOGIS services into web maps and/or web applications, please sign

  up for the NJ Geospatial Forum discussion listserv for early notification of

  service changes. Visit https://nj.gov/njgf/about/listserv/ for more

  information.
