notes: 'This dataset contains trends in days violating air quality standards by date

  for the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA).In

  order to convey the health impacts of air pollution to the general public, the

  US EPA has created a color-coded scale to identify pollutant levels in simple

  terms. This scale is referred to as the Air Quality Index (AQI). AQI levels

  are directly related to the federal air quality standards and pollutant

  concentrations in the air. The AQI reports pollutant levels for six different

  categories based on AQI: Good or green (0 to 50), Moderate or yellow (51 to

  100), Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups or orange (101 to 150), Unhealthy or red

  (151 to 200), Very Unhealthy or purple (201 to 300), and Hazardous (301 to

  500). Note that no day in 2000 or subsequent years has qualified as hazardous,

  so it is not present in the charts. Sensitive groups are defined as children,

  older adults, and those with breathing impairments. When the AQI reaches Code

  Orange or higher for any of the pollutants, an air quality standard violation

  has occurred. Air quality standards have been revised a number of times since

  1997, and the data in these charts is normalized to the current standard.
