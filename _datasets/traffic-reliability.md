notes: "Nonrecurring congestion is measured by the the Planning Time Index (PTI),\n\
  which is the ratio of the 95th percentile travel time relative to the free-\nflow\
  \ (uncongested) travel time. PTI helps in understanding the impacts of\nnonrecurring\
  \ congestion from crashes, weather, and special events. It\napproximates the extent\
  \ to which a traveler should add extra time to their\ntrip to ensure on-time arrival\
  \ at their destination. A value of 1.0 indicates\na person can expect free-flow\
  \ speeds along their route. A 2.0 index value\nindicates a traveler should expect\
  \ that the trip could be twice as long as\nfree-flow conditions. PTI values from\
  \ 2.0 to 3.0 are considered moderately\nunreliability and ones greater than 3.0\
  \ are highly unreliable. The data comes\nfrom aggregated Global Positioning System\
  \ probe data\u2014data from mobile apps,\nconnected vehicles, and commercial fleets\u2014\
  provided to the Probe Data Analytics\n(PDA) Suite by INRIX, a travel data technology\
  \ company. The PDA Suite was\ncreated by a consortium of sponsors, including the\
  \ Eastern Transportation\nCoalition and the University of Maryland. PTI values by\
  \ region, subregion, and\ncounty are grouped either as freeway facilities or local\
  \ roads. Freeways are\nroadway segments classified as interstates, turnpikes, and\
  \ expressways in the\nPDA Suite. Local roads are segments classified as U.S. routes,\
  \ state routes,\nparkways, frontages, and others. The PDA Suite reports out weekday\
  \ hourly\naverages in facility directions (northbound, southbound, eastbound, and\n\
  westbound) by selected facility types and geographies. Data is also reported\nby\
  \ time of day (TOD) an average of these hourly and directional values by\nfacility\
  \ type, within the following time periods: Morning (AM): 6:00 AM\u20139:59\nAM;\
  \ Midday (MD): 10:00 AM\u20132:59 PM; Evening (PM): 3:00 PM\u20136:59 PM; Nighttime\n\
  (NT): 7:00 PM\u20135:59 AM; and Daily: 12:00 AM\u201311:59 PM. All values reflect\
  \ an\naverage weekday.\n\n"
