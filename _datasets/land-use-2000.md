notes: 'Every five years, since 1990, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission

  has produced a GIS Land Use layer for its 9-county region. In 2000, digital

  orthophotography was flown by DVRPC. Utilizing this orthophotography, all Land

  Use annotation and digitizing was performed on-screen, or "heads-up," a first

  at DVRPC. Digitizing was done using ESRI ArcGIS 8 software at a 1:2400 (1 inch

  = 200 feet) scale. An ArcGIS Personal GeoDatabase was created for each county

  in the DVRPC region. These Personal GeoDatabases were then exported to ESRI

  shapefiles for distribution to the public.
