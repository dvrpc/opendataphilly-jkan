notes: 'A commonly accepted threshold for affordable housing costs at the household

  level is 30% of a household''s income. Accordingly, a household is considered

  cost burdened if it pays more than 30% of its income on housing. Households

  paying more than 50% are considered severely cost burdened. These thresholds

  apply to both homeowners and renters. The Housing Affordability indicator only

  measures cost burden among the region''s households, and not the supply of

  affordable housing. The directionality of cost burden trends can be impacted

  by changes in both income and housing supply. If lower income households are

  priced out of a county or the region, it would create a downward trend in cost

  burden, but would not reflect a positive trend for an inclusive housing

  market.
